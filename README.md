# tabgroups
a simple tablist styling plugin for spigot. this is essentially a feature-reduced and open source version of a plugin i made for [firestarter](https://github.com/firestarter) with dependencies on proprietary libraries stripped out.

there's a handful of decent tablist plugins available for spigot, but most are too complex or have shitty performance. this plugin strikes a nice balance between features and performance which should be suitable for most servers.
